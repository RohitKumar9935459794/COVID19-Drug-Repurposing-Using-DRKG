# COVID-19 Drug Repurposing using DRKG

This repository reproduces baseline experiments from the
**Drug Repurposing Knowledge Graph (DRKG)** using pretrained TransE embeddings.

## Contents
- Disease–Compound based drug repurposing for COVID-19
- Gene–Compound based drug repurposing using COVID host genes
- Ranking of FDA-approved drugs using edge scores

## Status
🚧 **Reproduction Phase**

These notebooks reproduce official DRKG example workflows
for learning, verification, and as a baseline for future experiments.

## Future Work (Planned)
- Integration of disease-based and gene-based scores
- Gene importance weighting
- Rank stability and robustness analysis
- Biological interpretation of top-ranked drugs

## Acknowledgment
This work is based on the Drug Repurposing Knowledge Graph (DRKG).
